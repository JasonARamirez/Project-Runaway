Project Runaway:

Road trip planning App. 
User enters a final destination along with a starting time/date.
App returns directions along with a hourly log of the weather at that time.
If weather conditions are not well, the app will try to suggest a better start time.
BONUS: User places make and model of car, allows app to return places to stop for gas/eat food.
